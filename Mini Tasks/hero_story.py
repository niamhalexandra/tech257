# Define a dictionary called story1. It should have the following keys:
# 'start', 'middle' and 'end'

    'middle': input("In the city of Metroville, there is a brave software engineer, battling a dangerous AI named Nemesis. The engineer faces a dilemma: attempt to shut Nemesis down and risk his life, or retreat and let Nemesis wreak havoc. With time running out, they must decide the fate of the city, how does he feel?

# Print the entire dictionary
print(story1)
# Print the type of your dictionary
print(type(story1))
# Print only the keys
print(story1.keys())
# Print only the values
print(story1.values())
# Print the individual values using the keys (individually, lots of print commands)
# Now, let's add a new key:value pair:
# 'hero': yourSuperHero

# Hints:

# THE MORE CREATIVE THE BETTER
# If time
# Improve the program. For example, can you make it a "Choose your own adventure" story?
