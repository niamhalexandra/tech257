# Intro to Cloud Computing

### _The Cloud is basically a metaphor for a global network of remote servers that store data, run applications and deliver content/services over the internet_ 

* It's an alternative to using on-prem data centres and is essentially like renting a space to store your data etc somewhere remote.

### A brief history and timeline of cloud computing:

* The concept of virtualization came about in circa 1960 laying the foundtions for cloud computing
* Come the 1990's VPNs and internet services had arrived
* In the early 2000's Amazon launched AWS pioneering the now 'cloud computing model'
* Mid 2000's saw Microsoft and Google create their own cloud platforms
* At present, cloud computing is used in day to day life and more and more business' migrate over to cloud from their traditional on-prem infrastructure

### So what can cloud computing do?
* Run Vm's and containers
* Store/manage data
* Develop and deploy software applications
* Be used for data analytics & Machine learning 
* To share documents and enable collaboration 
* Enable remote work 

### Types/Models of Cloud 

1. Public Cloud 
2. Private Cloud
3. Hybrid Cloud
4. Multi-Cloud

### Different Cloud services:

1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
3. Software as a Service (SaaS)

### Advantages:
* Cost Savings
* Scalability
* Flexibility
* Disaster Recovery/Redundancy
* Automatic Updates
* Good security
* Service Level Agreement (SLA)

### Disadvantages:
* Security Concerns 
* Dependence on Internet Connection 
* Compliance and Legal Issues 
* Limited Customization Options

### OpEx vs CapEx

* OpEx (Operational Expenditure): Ongoing expenses for running a business and maintenance, such as cloud service subscriptions.
* CapEx (Capital Expenditure): Upfront investment in physical assets or infrastructure, such as purchasing servers.

### Marketshare for Cloud Providers

1. Top spot for most popular is AWS
2. Microsoft Azure is second
3. Google Cloud is next popular 
4. Below are other lesser used providers e.g Oracle

### What makes them so popular?
* AWS: Extensive service offerings and global presence. 
* Azure: Integration with Microsoft products and services. 
* GCP: Advanced data analytics and machine learning capabilities.

### Some examples of cloud in use!
* Netflix: Migrated from on-premises data centers to AWS for scalability and reliability. 
* Airbnb: Leveraged AWS for handling peak traffic and global expansion. 
* Spotify: Utilized Google Cloud Platform for data analytics and machine learning.

### What is Cloud Computing as a Business Model:
* Subscription-based model: Users pay for cloud services on a pay-as-you-go or subscription basis.
* Revenue streams include service subscriptions, usage fees, and value-added services.

### Intro to the 4 Pillars of DevOps

1. Culture 
2. Automation
3. Measurement
4. Sharing

### The things that cost:
* Compute resources (VMs, containers etc)
* Storage
* Network Bandwidth
* Support & Maintenance fees
* Database services

## Some Different Facts!

* Green Cloud initiatives are really being driven forward in an evolvingly environmentally friendly world. With GCP and Azure being carbon neutral through methods of planting trees. AWS is also planning it''s map towards being carbon neutral with the itention of shifting operations to become 100% powered by renewable energy.'
* Now more than 70% of business have more than half of their infrastructure in the cloud
* 65% of organizations are using multi-cloud environments
* Cloud gaming is becoming more mainstream/prevalent
